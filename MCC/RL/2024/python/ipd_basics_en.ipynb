    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) is a **simultaneous**, **two-player**, **non-zero-sum** game, highlighted by Merill Flood & Melvin Dreschler in 1950 to show that Nash's balance is not always ideal. The iterated version of the game (IPD) allows you to express strategies that are based on the game history, and therefore learn from the past. In 1980 Robert Axelrod organized a competition for the iterated version of the game in which one of the participants, Anatol Rappoport, highlighted the famous TFT strategy. This iterated version and TFT strategy were popularized in 1984 in Robert Axelrod's book \"The Evolution of Cooperation\". Since then, thousands of publications have been produced on this subject, in all fields!\n",

    "# A strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "A strategy aims to decide which move to play. In addition to the payoff matrix, the information available for a strategy is the moves played by both players in the past. The simplest strategies are obviously those that do not take into account this past, such as strategies that periodically play the same sequence of moves. To ensure a principle of autonomy of each agent, a strategy is of course able to provide his next move, but takes care of storing his previous moves if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Let's create a class of strategies of this category\n",
    "The class we define here is very simple: strategies that periodically play moves, without thinking much! For the moment, it is not linked to any game since this kind of behaviour can be found in any game."

    "# Ecological competitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Tournaments give an interesting, but insufficient ranking. They do not study the robustness of a strategy according to the number of opponents' representants. Ecological competition responds to this problem: it makes it possible to vary the populations of each strategy. The principle of ecological competition is very simple. Initially, we consider `pop` representants of each of the `s` strategies evaluated. The `pop*s` representants all play against each other in a tournament. In step 1, the representants of each strategy are determined in proportion to their success in the previous step. The better you are, the more descendants you will have. An ecological competition therefore requires a strategy to be robust to changes in the number of representatives of each opponent. An ecological ranking is therefore more \"robust\" than a tournament ranking. It is immediately understood that to be well ranked, it is preferable to play very well against your own colleagues, since with a little luck, they will be more and more numerous.\n",
    "An ecological competition can then be represented on a temporal graph, the generations on the abscissa and the populations of each strategy on the ordinate. We will use `matplotlib` to compute these graphs."

    "An elegant way to generate strategies is to define a genotype and instantiate it in every possible way: It is easy and objective. A genotype is built here based on the memory of strategies. A strategy belonging to the set `Mem(x,y)` reason on its last x moves as well as the last y moves of its opponent. For example, a strategy belonging to the family `Mem(1,1)` reasoned on its last move and the last move played by its opponent. There is the first move, then 2^2 possible configurations, so a genotype of 5 cells. Instanciated in every possible way, this is therefore 2^5 strategies in this set."
